HAL Switch
==========

This is the software for the HAL Switch, a wall-mounted capacitive-sensing
switching solution developed for MAG Laboratory.

The switch detects a press on the capacive pads mounted on the front and 
activates when a press is detected.

Are we sure that it works?  No.  But it will be fun to test.
